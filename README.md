## Quick Start

### Use from PyPI

If you just want to use the MCP server, you do not need to clone this repository.

```bash
# Run the latest published package directly
uvx --from sequential-thinking mcp-sequential-thinking

# Or install the command as a persistent uv tool
uv tool install sequential-thinking
mcp-sequential-thinking

# Or install it into a project/virtual environment
uv venv
uv pip install sequential-thinking
mcp-sequential-thinking
```

### Local development

1. **Set Up Project**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix

   # Install package and dependencies in editable mode
   uv pip install -e .

   # For development with testing tools
   uv sync --group dev
   ```

2. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   # Run directly
   uv run -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server

   # Or use the installed script
   mcp-sequential-thinking
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests with coverage
   uv run --group dev pytest

   # Run linting and type checks
   uv run --group dev ruff check .
   uv run --group dev basedpyright
   ```

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Option 1: Using the virtual environment (recommended for Linux/macOS)

If you have set up the project with `uv venv && uv pip install -e .`, point directly to the venv Python interpreter. This avoids dependency resolution issues (e.g., on systems with Python 3.14+):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Using uv run

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Using PyPI with uvx (recommended for users)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "sequential-thinking",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 4: Using the installed entry point

If you've installed the command with `uv tool install sequential-thinking`, `pip install sequential-thinking`, or `uv pip install sequential-thinking`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "mcp-sequential-thinking"
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 5: Using uvx from GitHub

Use this if you want the latest repository version instead of the latest PyPI release:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/feniix/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Editor & IDE Integration

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor MCP configuration at `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or globally at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (Copilot MCP)

VS Code supports MCP servers since version 1.99+. Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace or to your user `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Enable MCP support in VS Code via `"chat.mcp.enabled": true` in your settings.

### Zed

Add to your Zed settings (`~/.config/zed/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": {
        "path": "uv",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--directory",
          "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
          "-m",
          "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code (CLI)

Add the server using the CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking -- uv run --directory /path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server
```

Or manually create/edit `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to your Windsurf MCP configuration at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "-m",
        "mcp_sequential_thinking.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Gemini CLI

Add to your Gemini CLI settings at `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "sequential-thinking",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** For normal use, prefer the PyPI `uvx --from sequential-thinking mcp-sequential-thinking` configuration. For local development, use `uv run --directory /path/to/mcp-sequential-thinking -m mcp_sequential_thinking.server` or point directly to the venv Python interpreter (see [Claude Desktop Option 1](#option-1-using-the-virtual-environment-recommended-for-linuxmacos)).

# How It Works

The server maintains a history of thoughts and processes them through a structured workflow. Each thought is validated using Pydantic models, categorized into thinking stages, and stored with relevant metadata in a thread-safe storage system. The server automatically handles data persistence, backup creation, and provides tools for analyzing relationships between thoughts.

## Usage Guide

The Sequential Thinking server exposes five main tools:

### 1. `process_thought`

Records and analyzes a new thought in your sequential thinking process.

**Parameters:**

- `thought` (string): The content of your thought
- `thought_number` (integer): Position in your sequence (e.g., 1 for first thought)
- `total_thoughts` (integer): Expected total thoughts in the sequence
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean): Whether more thoughts are needed after this one
- `stage` (string): The thinking stage - must be one of:
  - "Problem Definition"
  - "Research"
  - "Analysis"
  - "Synthesis"
  - "Conclusion"
- `tags` (list of strings, optional): Keywords or categories for your thought
- `axioms_used` (list of strings, optional): Principles or axioms applied in your thought
- `assumptions_challenged` (list of strings, optional): Assumptions your thought questions or challenges

**Example:**

```python
# First thought in a 5-thought sequence
process_thought(
    thought="The problem of climate change requires analysis of multiple factors including emissions, policy, and technology adoption.",
    thought_number=1,
    total_thoughts=5,
    next_thought_needed=True,
    stage="Problem Definition",
    tags=["climate", "global policy", "systems thinking"],
    axioms_used=["Complex problems require multifaceted solutions"],
    assumptions_challenged=["Technology alone can solve climate change"]
)
```

### 2. `generate_summary`

Generates a summary of your entire thinking process.

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalThoughts": 5,
    "stages": {
      "Problem Definition": 1,
      "Research": 1,
      "Analysis": 1,
      "Synthesis": 1,
      "Conclusion": 1
    },
    "timeline": [
      {"number": 1, "stage": "Problem Definition"},
      {"number": 2, "stage": "Research"},
      {"number": 3, "stage": "Analysis"},
      {"number": 4, "stage": "Synthesis"},
      {"number": 5, "stage": "Conclusion"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. `clear_history`

Resets the thinking process by clearing all recorded thoughts.

### 4. `export_session`

Exports the current thinking session to a JSON file for sharing or backup.

**Parameters:**

- `file_path` (string): Path to the output JSON file (parent directories are created automatically)

**Example:**

```python
export_session(file_path="/home/user/exports/my-analysis.json")
```

### 5. `import_session`

Imports a previously exported thinking session from a JSON file.

**Parameters:**

- `file_path` (string): Path to the JSON file to import

## Practical Applications

- **Decision Making**: Work through important decisions methodically
- **Problem Solving**: Break complex problems into manageable components
- **Research Planning**: Structure your research approach with clear stages
- **Writing Organization**: Develop ideas progressively before writing
- **Project Analysis**: Evaluate projects through defined analytical stages


## Getting Started

With the proper MCP setup, simply use the `process_thought` tool to begin working through your thoughts in sequence. As you progress, you can get an overview with `generate_summary` and reset when needed with `clear_history`.
